## Introduction Of Project
The rule of the game is very easy.

First the user should set a guessNumber and then he can ask his friend to play this game.

His friend should touch the addButton and input a number. If the number is bigger than the guessNumber, the system will show him that the number is too big. And if the number is too small, the system will also show him that the number is too small.

At last, he will find the guessNumber.
